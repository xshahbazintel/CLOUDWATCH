Observability is the ability to measure internal state of system by examining the data it produces such as logs, metrics, and traces. It helps us to understand what happened in system if anything goes wrong.

Logs: These are timestamped text records.

Metrics: These are numeric valued data about performance such as CPU utilisation, Memory usage, request rate and throughput.

Traces: Records of the path a request takes through the system to understand latency and dependencies.

Why do we need observability?

Better user experience
reducing application downtime
cost optimisation
enhanced security
